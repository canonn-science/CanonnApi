				This is the Canonn API. The API will allow you to easily consume the data that
				<i>Canonn.science</i> gathers during its research.
			</p>
			<p><b>Important information:</b>
				There is no need to sign in if you just want to browse the data. Unless you know you should be able to edit the data, and have been granted permission to do so (ask the Canonn R&D team for that), there will be no difference for you even if you sign in.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is work in progress. And we need to come up with a bit more content ;-)
			</p>

			<p>
				Geeky information: This administration interface is build with Angular 4.0 beta. The API is build on top of .NET Core.
				You can find the source at <a href="https://github.com/canonn-science/ruins" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i> Github</a>
